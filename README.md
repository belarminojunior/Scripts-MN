## The Range-Kutta Method (RK4)

The RangeKutta method is a numerical technique used to approximate the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). It is named after the German mathematicians Carl Runge and Martin Wilhelm Kutta, who independently developed the method in the late 19th century. The RangeKutta method is widely used due to its simplicity and accuracy in solving ODEs numerically.

### How does it work?

The RangeKutta method approximates the solution of an ODE by iteratively calculating the values of the function at different points. The general form of a first-order ODE is:

dy/dx = f(x, y)

where dy/dx is the derivative of y with respect to x, and f(x, y) is a known function.

The RangeKutta method involves dividing the interval over which the solution is sought into a series of smaller steps. The basic idea is to compute the value of y at each step, using the information from the previous step.
